# Exercise 1
sku_list = [7046538, 8289407, 9056375, 2308597]

# checkpoint 1 - Use dir() on sku_list and print out the result. 
print(dir(sku_list))

# checkpoint 2 - Create a variable called sku_iterator_object_one that is equal to calling .__iter__() on sku_list. Lastly, print sku_iterator_object_one
sku_iterator_object_one = sku_list.__iter__()
print(sku_iterator_object_one)

#checkpoint 3 - Create a variable called sku_iterator_object_two that is equal to calling iter() on sku_list. Lastly, print sku_iterator_object_two!
sku_iterator_object_two = iter(sku_list)
print(sku_iterator_object_two)

# Exercise 2

dog_foods = {
  "Great Dane Foods": 4,
  "Min Pip Pup Foods": 10,
  "Pawsome Pup Foods": 8
}

# Checkpooint 1 - create a variable called dog_food_iterator that stores the value of calling iter() on our iterable dog_foods.
dog_food_iterator = iter(dog_foods)

# Checkpoint 3 - etrieve the first value of the dog_food_iterator using the built-in function next() and set it to a variable called next_dog_food1. Print next_dog_food1 to see the result.
next_dog_food1 = next(dog_food_iterator)
print(next_dog_food1) 

# Checkpoint 4 -mRetrieve the next two values of the dog_food_iterator using the __next__() method and set them to the variables next_dog_food2 and next_dog_food3. Print both variables to see the results!
next_dog_food2 = dog_food_iterator.__next__()
print(next_dog_food2)
next_dog_food3 = dog_food_iterator.__next__() 
print(next_dog_food3)

# Exercise 3
# Checkpoint 1 - Imagine we have a custom class called CustomerCounter that counts the number of customers in the store. Make this class iterable by first defining the __iter__() method. Within this method, initialize a class member called self.count that will keep count of the number of customers in the store.
class CustomerCounter:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.count = 0
    return self

# Checkpoint 2 - Next, define the __next__() method. Only 1 customer will enter at a time each time this __next__() method is called.
  def __next__(self):
    self.count +=1

# Checkpoint 4 - If we were to iterate through the customer_counter object using a for loop now, we would get an infinite loop since our __next__() method has not raised a StopIteration exception.
# Let’s fix this by moving on to Step 5 where we can raise this exception and prevent an infinite loop from occurring!
# Checkpoint 5 - Modify the __next__() method to raise a StopIteration exception when our customer count is greater than 100.
    if self.count > 100:
      raise StopIteration
    return self.count

# Checkpoint 3 - Create a class instance customer_counter from the CustomerCounter class
customer_counter = CustomerCounter()

# Checkpoint 6 - Create a for loop to iterate through our CustomerCounter class object customer_counter. Print out each customer count value on each loop iteration.
for customer_count in customer_counter:
  print(customer_count)

# Exercise 4
# Checkpoint 1 - We have several 13.5lb bags of dog food to display. Our single shelving unit however can only hold a maximum of 1,000lbs. Let’s figure out how many bags of food we can display! First, import the itertools module at the top line of the code editor.
import itertools
max_capacity = 1000
num_bags = 0

# Checkpoint 2 - Next, initialize a for loop with a count() iterator that keeps track of the weight on the shelf.
# Within the for loop body:
# Provide a stop condition using max_capacity to terminate the loop
# Increment num_bags on each iteration.
for dog_food in itertools.count(start=13.5, step=13.5):
  if dog_food >= 1000:
    break
  num_bags += 1

# Checkpoint 3 - Print the num_bags result to see how many bags will fit on the shelving unit.
print(num_bags)

# Exercise 5 - Use the chain() itertool set to a variable named all_skus_iterator to combine the SKU lists.
import itertools

great_dane_foods = [2439176, 3174521, 3560031]
min_pin_pup_foods = [6821904, 3302083]
pawsome_pup_foods = [9664865]

all_skus_iterator = itertools.chain(great_dane_foods, min_pin_pup_foods, pawsome_pup_foods)

# Checkpoint 2 - Using all_skus_iterator implement a for loop to output each SKU.
for skus in all_skus_iterator:
  print(skus)

# Exercise 6 
import itertools
collars = ["Red-S","Red-M", "Blue-XS", "Green-L", "Green-XL", "Yellow-M"]

# Checkpoint 1 - Use the combinations() itertool to do this. Set the returned iterator to a variable named collar_combo_iterator.
collar_combo_iterator = itertools.combinations(collars , 3)

# Checkpoint 2 - Using a for loop, print each item in collar_combo_iterator to see all the possible collar combinations.
for combo in collar_combo_iterator:
  print(combo)

# Exercise 7 
import itertools
max_money = 15
options = []

# Checkpoint 1 - Create a list iterable from the table provided that contains tuples of (cat_toy, price). The list should be called cat_toys.
cat_toys = [("laser", 1.99), ("fountain", 5.99), ("scratcher", 10.99), ("catnip", 15.99)]

# Checkpoint 2 - Using iter(), create an iterator called cat_toy_iterator that retrieves the iterator for cat_toys
cat_toy_iterator = iter(cat_toys)

# Checkpoint 3 - Using four next() statements, print out each value in cat_toy_iterator.
print(next(cat_toy_iterator))
print(next(cat_toy_iterator))
print(next(cat_toy_iterator))
print(next(cat_toy_iterator))

# Checkpoint 4 - First, import itertools at the top of the module. See above under checkpoint 1
# Checkpoint 5 -  create a combinations() iterator called toy_combos to retrieve all combinations of 2 total toys from the cat_toys list.
toy_combos = itertools.combinations(cat_toys, 2)

# Checkpoint 6 - Uncomment all lines of the for loop. After the final line within the for loop, check if the price of cost_of_toy1 and cost_of_toy2 is less than or equal to max_money which is the max $15 the customer has to spend. If it is, add the tuple to the options list.
for combo in toy_combos:
  toy1 = combo[0]
  cost_of_toy1 = toy1[1]
  toy2 = combo[1]
  cost_of_toy2 = toy2[1]
  if cost_of_toy1 + cost_of_toy2 <= max_money:
    options.append(combo)

# Print the final options list
print(options)
